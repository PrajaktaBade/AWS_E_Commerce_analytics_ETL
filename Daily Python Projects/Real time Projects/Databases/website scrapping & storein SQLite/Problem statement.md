Build Real Python Skills by Combining Web Scraping and Databases ðŸš€

One of the most powerful uses of Python is pulling data from the web and storing it locally for analysis, search, or even powering your own apps.
Thatâ€™s why these daily practice projects are so valuable â€” each one adds a new tool to your problem-solving toolkit.
Today, youâ€™ll build a small but super practical program that scrapes data from a website using BeautifulSoup and saves it into an SQLite database.

This is exactly how countless internal tools and dashboards start: a script that gathers data and keeps it organized in a database you can query anytime.

Project Task

Your challenge is to write a Python program that:

âœ… Fetches data from the website

http://books.toscrape.com/

â€” a site made specifically for practicing web scraping.
âœ… Extracts each bookâ€™s title and price from the main page.
âœ… Saves this data into a local SQLite database file called books.db, inside a table named books with columns title and price.
âœ… Prints out the data it found so you can see it before it goes into the database.

By doing this, youâ€™ll practice:

Sending HTTP requests and downloading HTML with requests,
Parsing and extracting specific data using BeautifulSoup,
Working with SQLite to create tables and insert records,
And tying all these skills together into a practical end-to-end script.
